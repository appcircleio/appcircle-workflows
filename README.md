# Appcircle Default Workflow Definitions
This repository serves as the master source for the default definitions for the Appcircle Build module workflows.
When you create a new build profile, the initial workflow is based on the definitions in this repository depending on the selected target platform and the OS.

Appcircle build workflows provide a powerful and flexible way to manage your mobile CI/CD process. You can extend your mobile CI/CD with the rich component library.

## Working with the Workflows
You can find more information about the workflows in your build in the [Appcircle Documentation](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/).
